# 🛡️ Canon Boundary Guard

Canon Boundary Guard is a Codex plugin that packages a provenance-boundary
skill and an optional hook bundle.

It helps Codex keep project evidence, chat context, operator instructions,
working hypotheses, and model assumptions in separate cognitive layers during a
session.

The older standalone skill layout is preserved in the
`standalone-skill-v1` branch.

## 🔎 What It Does

Codex often works with several kinds of information at the same time:

- files already in the project
- messages from the current conversation
- instructions that tell Codex how to behave
- runtime context shown at the start of a session
- assumptions that come from the model itself

Canon Boundary Guard gives Codex a compact classification frame for those
sources.

The goal is not only to protect file edits. The frame is meant to stay useful
while Codex reads, reasons, decides, restructures, and eventually writes
persistent project content.

## ⚠️ Why It Exists

When Codex works on a repository, it reads more than files.

It may also use conversation history, runtime context, tool output,
instructions, compressed summaries, and model assumptions.

Those sources do not have the same authority.

A project file is not the same thing as a temporary chat message. An instruction
for Codex is not the same thing as content that belongs in the repository. A
model assumption is not the same thing as verified evidence.

Canon Boundary Guard exists to keep those boundaries visible while Codex
reasons, decides, and eventually writes persistent project content.

## 🧩 AGENTS.md Authority

In some Codex environments, such as editor-integrated sessions, `AGENTS.md`
instructions may appear at the start of the conversation as a visible user-role
message before the operator's real first request.

That display role is not enough to decide authority.

The block may refer to the current working directory, even when the actual
instruction source is global, such as an `AGENTS.md` stored in Codex home.

Canon Boundary Guard includes a countermeasure for this case: a leading block
starting with `AGENTS.md instructions for <path>` is treated as Codex runtime
instruction-chain material, not ordinary chat and not repository content.

When this distinction matters, verify the authority layer before using the
block as project evidence or writing it into persistent files.

## 📦 Install

Canon Boundary Guard is installed as a Codex plugin.

It is not installed like an old standalone skill.

1. Add this repository to Codex:

```txt
codex plugin marketplace add XxYouDeaDPunKxX/canon-boundary-guard-codex
```

2. Open Codex and open the plugin picker or plugin list. In Codex UIs that
   support slash commands, you can use:

```txt
/plugins
```

3. Install or enable Canon Boundary Guard.

4. Start a new thread.

5. Ask Codex to use it:

```txt
Use Canon Boundary Guard for this session.
```

For the hook to work, enable plugin hooks in your Codex config:

```toml
[features]
hooks = true
plugin_hooks = true
```

Then restart Codex. If your Codex UI exposes a hook review view such as
`/hooks`, use it to review and trust the bundled hook. In editor integrations
where `/hooks` is not available, open the plugin details or approve the hook
when Codex shows the trust prompt.

The hook is recommended, but the skill can still be used without it.

If you prefer the older manual setup, use the `standalone-skill-v1` branch and
copy the `canon-boundary-guard/` folder into your Codex skills directory.

## ▶️ Use

Use the plugin when a session depends on keeping old context, current
instructions, external information, working hypotheses, model assumptions, and
project evidence separate.

```txt
Use Canon Boundary Guard for this session.
```

You can also call the bundled skill directly:

```txt
Use $canon-boundary-guard for this session.
```

## 🧱 Plugin Structure

```txt
.agents/
`-- plugins/
    `-- marketplace.json
plugins/
`-- canon-boundary-guard-codex/
    |-- .codex-plugin/
    |   `-- plugin.json

            |-- references/frame.md
            `-- scripts/inject_frame.py
```

- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` exposes the plugin to Codex as a
  marketplace entry.
- `plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` identifies the
  plugin and points Codex to bundled skills and hooks.
- `plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/skills/canon-boundary-guard/SKILL.md`
  defines the full operating frame.
- `plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/skills/canon-boundary-guard/references/frame.md`
  contains the compact frame emitted by the hook script.
- `plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/skills/canon-boundary-guard/scripts/inject_frame.py`
  reads the compact frame and emits a hook payload.
- `plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/skills/canon-boundary-guard/agents/openai.yaml`
  contains Codex-facing skill metadata.
- `plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/hooks/hooks.json` wires the frame into
  `PreToolUse` for matched write tools when plugin hooks are enabled.

## 🧠 Operating Posture

The skill is designed to keep source classes separate throughout the session,
not only at write time.

The frame should affect reading, analysis, planning, conflict detection, and
persistence decisions. The hook only re-surfaces the compact frame near matched
write tools.

## 🧬 Provenance Layers

Canon Boundary Guard uses six source classes. They do not decide whether
something is true by themselves. They describe where the material came from and
whether it can safely become persistent project content.

- `L0 EVIDENCE`: project files, git state, tests, schemas, lockfiles,
  diagnostics, command output, or verified tool output.
- `L1 SHAPING`: conversation material not approved for persistence.
- `L1A AUTHORIZED DELTA`: operator-approved material for the current turn,
  before it is written.
- `L2 AGENT CONTROL`: instructions that shape agent behavior, not project
  content.
- `L2A CODEX INSTRUCTION CHAIN`: AGENTS guidance and runtime instruction-chain
  material.
- `L3 MODEL PRIOR`: unverified model memory, assumed conventions, generic best
  practice, or unstated framework behavior.

Non-L0 material is tagged only when the output would change if the source
changed.

The important boundary is persistence. L1, L2, L2A, and L3 can shape how Codex
works, but they should not silently become repository content. L1A can be
written only inside the scope approved by the operator. L2 and L2A require an
explicit request for agent-facing instructions before they can be persisted.

## 🧩 AGENTS.md Prelude

A leading user-role block starting with:

```txt
AGENTS.md instructions for <path>
```

is classified as `L2A` runtime instruction-chain material.

It is not operator chat, not project content, and not dependent on filesystem
confirmation. If it contains an `<environment_context>...</environment_context>`
block, that block is runtime metadata.

The first operator request starts after this prelude.

## 🔁 Hook Injection

`plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/skills/canon-boundary-guard/scripts/inject_frame.py`
is intentionally small. It reads
`plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/skills/canon-boundary-guard/references/frame.md`,
strips surrounding whitespace, and emits JSON for a Codex `PreToolUse` hook:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "additionalContext": "<contents of plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/skills/canon-boundary-guard/references/frame.md>"
  },
  "systemMessage": "<contents of plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/skills/canon-boundary-guard/references/frame.md>"
}
```

The hook is highly recommended for sessions where repository content, project
rules, protocols, naming, workflows, or `AGENTS.md` authority may matter. It is
intended for matched write tools, for example `apply_patch`, `Write`, or
`Edit`.

The hook is not the core mechanism of the skill. It is a reinforcement point
that re-surfaces the compact frame before matched write tools.

In current Codex runtimes, some edits may be applied through internal
file-change paths that do not expose a visible hook event. Treat the hook as a
best-effort reinforcement layer, not as complete enforcement.

The frame is injected as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, which is the
model-visible context path for `PreToolUse`. The same frame is also surfaced as a
`systemMessage` so the hook activity remains visible in the UI or event stream.

It does not block the tool call, rewrite the requested operation, or decide
project policy. Its job is to put the classification frame back into the
instruction stream at the moment a write may happen.

## 🪝 Plugin Hook Setup

The plugin manifest points to:

```txt
plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/hooks/hooks.json
```

The default hook configuration is:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "apply_patch|Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/canon-boundary-guard/scripts/inject_frame.py",
            "timeout": 5,
            "statusMessage": "Provenance frame"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Codex hooks use `hooks` as the canonical feature key. Plugin-bundled hooks are
off by default in this release. Enable both with:

```toml
[features]
hooks = true
plugin_hooks = true
```

After installation or hook changes, restart Codex. If your Codex UI exposes a
hook review view such as `/hooks`, use it to review and trust the bundled hook.
In editor integrations where `/hooks` is not available, open the plugin details
or approve the hook when Codex shows the trust prompt. Plugin hooks are
non-managed hooks and do not run until trusted.

If your system requires `python3` instead of `python`, adjust the hook command
in your local plugin copy or configure an equivalent hook in your Codex
`config.toml`.

## 🧯 Fallback Behavior

If
`plugins/canon-boundary-guard-codex/skills/canon-boundary-guard/references/frame.md`
is missing, the hook script still emits a `systemMessage`:

```txt
Canon Boundary Guard frame missing: provenance protection degraded.
```

This keeps the failure visible without blocking execution.

That fallback is deliberate: the skill should not make normal work impossible
because a local file is missing, but it should also not fail silently.
